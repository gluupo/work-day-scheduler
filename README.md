## objective
as a coder with a busy schedule, i want to add important events to a daily planner so that i can manage my time more effectively.

## usage
- the current date and time are displayed when you open the planner
- each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- click into a timeblock, enter an event and when you click the save button it is saved in local storage so the save events persist even upon refresh
